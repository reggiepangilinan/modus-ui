# Proximity

The basic purpose of proximity is to organize information.

UI Elements that are close to each other are perceived more related than elements that are further apart.
When elements are grouped together they become a visual unit that gives a clearer view of the
page structure and the hierarchy of information.

## Spacing

`modus-ui` uses the following format to divide the hierarchy of information both vertically and horizontally.

```
$space-xs: 5px;
$space-sm: 10px;
$space-md: 20px;
$space-lg: 30px;
$space-xl: 40px;
$space-xxl: 50px;
```

## Z-Index

This is a guide to the `z-index` system that modus-ui.

### Element hierarchy

- Tooltips and Popup

  Relative to the container `z-index: 2`

- Modal Dialog

  Ideally the topmost which has `z-index: 999`

- SideNav

  Just below the modal / dialog but higher than the header `z-index: 900`

- Header

  Just below the sidenav but higher than most components `z-index: 700`

```
-- Header
$z-index-700:  700;

-- SideNav
$z-index-900:  900;

-- Just in case there are elements above the modal dialog
$z-index-1200:  1200;
$z-index-1500:  1500;
```
