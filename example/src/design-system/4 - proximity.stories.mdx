# Proximity

The basic purpose of proximity is to mainly to organize information.

UI Elements that are close to each other are perceived more related than elements that are further apart.
When elements are grouped together they become a visual unit that gives a clearer view of the
page structure and the hierarchy of information.

## Spacing

`modus-ui` uses the following format to divide the hierarchy of information both vertically and horizontally.

```
$space-xs: 5px;
$space-sm: 10px;
$space-md: 20px;
$space-lg: 30px;
$space-xl: 40px;
$space-xxl: 50px;
```
